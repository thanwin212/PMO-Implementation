# PMO-Implementation

# Project: PMO Implementation (2023 - 2024)

## Overview
Based on my knowledge of project management, team management, dedication, and collaboration with different functional teams, Teconâ€™s management team considered me to lead in implementing a Project Management Office (PMO) in the organization. Tecon has managed projects through decentralized and varied project management practices, with each business unit using its own project methodologies, tools, and reporting mechanisms. The organization lacked standardized ways of initiating projects with business cases and measuring alignment with the company's strategic goals and vision. This project is currently under development and will continue until next April to be fully functional within the organization.

## Technologies and Tools Using in the Project
- Presentation
- MS Project Management
- Excel
- Word
- MS Visio

This project will exemplify my expertise in establishing a more structured project management mechanism, gaining a better understanding of the industry, fostering collaboration and communication, providing leadership, and implementing project evaluation and success measurement.
